# Data-Visualization
A walkthrough of the Data Analysis Lifecycle, including visualizations. Used in conjunction with US Census data.

### Discovery / Requirements
From the US Census data, I decided to run through the lifecycle and create visualizations off of the population of people aged 40-49 in Harrison County, MS. Time periods included for this cycle should be 2010 through 2017, to see the effects of hurricanes and tropical storms on the population predictions and accurate totals.

### Data Collection
I pulled the census data directly from the US Census website as a standard CSV file. I ensured the CSV file was included in the repo's .gitignore file to stop it from entering version control.
