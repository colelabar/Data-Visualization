# Data-Visualization
A walkthrough of the Data Analysis Lifecycle, including visualizations. Used in conjunction with US Census data.

### Discovery / Requirements
From the US Census data, I decided to run through the lifecycle and create visualizations off of the total population of people in Harrison County, Mississippi. Time periods included for this cycle should be 2010 through 2017, to see the effects of hurricanes and tropical storms on the population totals.

### Data Collection
I pulled the census data directly from the US Census website as a standard CSV file. I ensured the CSV file was included in the repo's .gitignore file to stop it from entering version control.

### Data-Prep / Cleaning
Fixing the dataset required a larger amount of work than anticipated, so much so that I was forced to re-download the data using more strict specificity to achieve a greater end result.

### Exploration / Planning
After careful consideration, I've decided that the data I've pulled will look best in a simple bar chart. Despite not being the most exciting of visualizations, it certainly accomplishes it's task.

### Modeling / Algorithms
The algorithms used to model the data into the bar chart are similar in structure to others done in class, using the d3 Javascript visualization tools to assist.

### Automation / Computation
Borrowing key aspects from other labs, and with the help of Google, I constructed the computational means to establish the graph and add the dataset into it.

### Review of Findings
At the end of the proverbial day, it appears that despite an increase in Hurricane Season intensity and danger, the population of the coastal Harrison County continues to rise at a steady pace. After many reiterations of this lab, from a bar-graph to a scatter-plot and back, the data is visualized.
